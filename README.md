# s_jobcenter

## About this script

s_jobcenter is the first script with nui made entierly by me

I've been working on this scritp for about 2 weeks now and I've decided to release it for **FREE** (Much Wow)
First I wanted to sell it but since it wasn't perfect I didn't wanted to make anyone pay for it.

Any help to improve it is welcome !

### If you want to configure the script you can modify those files: 
```
./s_jobcenter/config.json
./s_jobcenter/html/lang/*
```
### If you want to add more images go there:
```
./s_jobcenter/html/main/images
```
